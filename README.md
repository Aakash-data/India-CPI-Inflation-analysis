# India-CPI-Inflation-analysis

## Objective:
Category Contribution: Based on the latest month's data, identify the contribution of different broader categories (food, energy, transportation, education, etc.) towards the overall CPI basket. Combine similar categories into broader categories (e.g., "Food" for Meals, Beverages, Cereals) to get a clearer picture.

Question: Which category has the highest contribution to CPI calculation?
Inflation Trend: Analyze the trend of year-over-year (Y-o-Y) increases in CPI (rural + urban) inflation since 2017 for the entire basket of products combined. The General Index provides the overall inflation for the month.

Question: Create a graph depicting the growth rate Y-o-Y and identify the year with the highest inflation rate. Explain the reasons behind this high inflation rate.
Food Inflation: Given India's retail inflation reaching a 3-month high in November 2023 due to rising food prices, analyze which specific food items contributed most to this increase during the 12 months ending May 2023.

Questions: Investigate trends in broader food category prices, month-on-month changes, absolute changes in inflation, and the biggest contributor within each food category.
COVID-19 Impact: Analyze how the onset and progression of the COVID-19 pandemic affected inflation rates in India. Focus on key pandemic milestones like lockdowns and their impact on CPI inflation, especially for categories like healthcare, food, and essential services.

Global Economic Events: Investigate how major global economic events, such as fluctuations in imported oil prices, influenced India's inflation. Analyze the impact of imported oil price changes on inflation rates of different categories and identify the category most strongly affected.
